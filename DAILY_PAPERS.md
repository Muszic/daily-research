## [2025-12-14] StereoSpace: Depth-Free Synthesis of Stereo Geometry via End-to-End Diffusion in a Canonical Space
**Published:** 2025-12-11 | [Read Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10959v1)

> **Abstract:** We introduce StereoSpace, a diffusion-based framework for monocular-to-stereo synthesis that models geometry purely through viewpoint conditioning, without explicit depth or warping. A canonical rectified space and the conditioning guide the generator to infer correspondences and fill disocclusions end-to-end. To ensure fair and leakage-free evaluation, we introduce an end-to-end protocol that exc...
