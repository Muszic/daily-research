## [2025-12-14] Parallel Batch Dynamic Vertex Coloring in $O(\log Δ)$ Amortized Update Time
**Category:** cs.DC | **Published:** 2025-12-09 | [Read Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08742v1)

> **Abstract:** We present the first parallel batch-dynamic algorithm for maintaining a proper $(Δ+ 1)$-vertex coloring. Our approach builds on a new sequential dynamic algorithm inspired by the work of Bhattacharya et al. (SODA'18). The resulting randomized algorithm achieves $O(\log Δ)$ expected amortized update time and, for any batch of $b$ updates, has parallel span $O(\operatorname{polylog} b + \operatorname{polylog} n)$ with high probability.

## [2025-12-14] StereoSpace: Depth-Free Synthesis of Stereo Geometry via End-to-End Diffusion in a Canonical Space
**Published:** 2025-12-11 | [Read Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10959v1)

> **Abstract:** We introduce StereoSpace, a diffusion-based framework for monocular-to-stereo synthesis that models geometry purely through viewpoint conditioning, without explicit depth or warping. A canonical rectified space and the conditioning guide the generator to infer correspondences and fill disocclusions end-to-end. To ensure fair and leakage-free evaluation, we introduce an end-to-end protocol that exc...
