### Problem

Existing research on autonomous taxi (AT) adoption primarily relies on hypothetical scenarios or simulated environments, leading to cognitive biases and a lack of external validity regarding actual user perceptions and behavioral responses. While conventional discrete choice models focus on observable factors, they often overlook crucial underlying cognitive and attitudinal constructs (e.g., trust in automation, perceived safety, policy acceptance) that significantly shape preferences for novel mobility services. This gap in understanding real-world adoption patterns, based on operational AT services, hinders effective policy-making and deployment strategies.

### Method

This study addresses the gap by investigating traveler adoption of ATs based on the *actual, large-scale deployment* of Baidu's Apollo Robotaxi (AR) service in Wuhan, China, where it operates fully driverless (SAE Level 4/5).

1.  **Data Collection:** A realistic survey was designed, incorporating actual service attributes of the AR system. 336 valid responses were collected from both actual AR users and general travelers in Wuhan. Adoption behavior was measured by the selection frequency of autonomous taxis in ten realistic travel scenarios.
2.  **Analysis:** Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed, comprising both measurement and structural models. This approach allowed for:
    *   Uncovering underlying latent factors through explanatory factor analysis.
    *   Identifying and measuring six latent psychological constructs: Trust & Policy Support, Cost Sensitivity, Performance, Behavioral Intention, Lifestyle, and Education.
    *   Systematically exploring the interrelationships among these constructs and their influences on AT adoption behavior.

### Impact

The study provides crucial empirical evidence from a real-world, fully operational autonomous taxi deployment, offering a more grounded understanding of user adoption dynamics.

1.  **Key Findings:** Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention were identified as the strongest positive predictors of AT adoption, while other latent constructs played more nuanced roles. The SEM model demonstrated strong goodness-of-fit across multiple indices.
2.  **Practical Implications:** The findings offer actionable insights for stakeholders:
    *   **Policymakers:** Support informed policy-making for integrating ATs into urban transportation systems.
    *   **Operators:** Guide effective fare design strategies, public outreach campaigns, and service improvements to enhance user acceptance and facilitate the scaling of AT deployments in real urban environments.
3.  **Academic Contribution:** Moves beyond hypothetical scenarios to reveal the cognitive foundations and psychological drivers of AT mode choice decisions, contributing to a more nuanced and informed transition towards widespread urban autonomous mobility.
