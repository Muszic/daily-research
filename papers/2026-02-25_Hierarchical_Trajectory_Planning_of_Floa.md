Here's a summary of the research paper in Markdown format:

### Problem

Trajectory planning for floating-base multi-link robots (which can change shape during flight) in confined environments is an open challenge. The problem lies in a high-dimensional, constraint-rich space where:
1.  **Collision avoidance** must adapt to the robot's variable footprint.
2.  **Kinematic limits** need to be respected.
3.  **Dynamic feasibility** must be maintained, specifically **avoiding control singularities** that can degrade controllability.
Existing methods are often computationally expensive, rely on simplified models, suffer from local optima, lack continuous trajectory optimization, or don't adequately address dynamic feasibility or the exploitation of the robot's morphological flexibility.

### Method

The authors introduce a **hierarchical trajectory planning framework** that integrates global guidance with configuration-aware local optimization, designed for floating-base multi-link robots.

1.  **Global Anchor State Generation:**
    *   Exploits the "dual nature" of these robots: the root link acts as a rigid body for global guidance, while articulated joints provide flexibility.
    *   First, a low-dimensional A\* search generates a collision-free geometric reference path for the robot's root link.
    *   Sequentially, "global anchor states" (full robot configurations) are generated by:
        *   Constructing a set of candidate local target states by exploring configurations one link length ahead and sampling joint angles.
        *   Evaluating each candidate for feasibility, ensuring it is:
            *   **Collision-free** using Euclidean Signed Distance Fields (ESDF) queries on rotor positions.
            *   **Controllable** by quantitatively checking if the available control torques form a valid convex polyhedron, thus avoiding control singularities.
        *   Selecting the "best" feasible candidate based on its proximity to the global reference path and progress along it.
    *   These anchor states decompose the overall high-dimensional planning problem into a series of independently solvable segments.

2.  **Local Trajectory Optimization:**
    *   Each trajectory segment between two successive global anchor states is optimized *in parallel*.
    *   Clamped B-spline trajectory parameterization is used to ensure inherent continuity across global segments.
    *   Optimization enforces collision avoidance, kinematic limits, and dynamic feasibility by avoiding control singularities.
    *   All objectives and constraints are formulated differentiably.

3.  **System Implementation:**
    *   The complete system directly processes raw point-cloud data from the environment, eliminating the need for handcrafted obstacle models.

### Impact

This framework represents a significant advance in robotic autonomy:

1.  **Enables Novel Maneuvering:** It allows articulated aerial robots to effectively exploit their morphology (shape-changing ability) to maneuver in highly confined environments, achieving feats impossible for rigid robots.
2.  **First Real-World Demonstration:** To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first planning framework for floating-base multi-link robots that has been successfully demonstrated on a *real robot* to generate continuous, collision-free, and dynamically feasible trajectories directly from raw point-cloud inputs, without relying on handcrafted obstacle models.
3.  **Improved Reliability and Efficiency:** For practitioners, it offers improved reliability in complex spaces by allowing robots to adapt their body shape and reduces the need for manual environment modeling.
4.  **Future Potential:** The capabilities pave the way for wider deployment in critical applications such as industrial inspection, infrastructure maintenance, search and rescue, and hazardous-area exploration, and can inspire similar solutions for other transformable robotic platforms.
