### Problem

*   **Model Interpretability Challenge:** Computing feature importance (e.g., using Shapley values) is critical for understanding model predictions, especially in high-stakes applications.
*   **Access Limitations:** Traditional methods for computing Shapley values require direct access to the underlying machine learning model, which is often unavailable in real-world scenarios due due to proprietary models, APIs, privacy, or security concerns.
*   **Computational Cost:** Even with model access, exact Shapley value computation is often prohibitively expensive.
*   **Goal:** Investigate whether meaningful Shapley value estimations can be obtained in a **zero-shot setting**, using only the input data distribution and model predictions, without model access, gradients, or reference explanations.

### Method

*   **Introducing ExplainerPFN:** The paper proposes ExplainerPFN, a tabular foundation model built upon the TabPFN framework, specifically designed for model-free zero-shot feature importance estimation.
*   **Meta-Learning Objective:** ExplainerPFN adapts TabPFN by replacing its predictive objective with a Shapley-value meta-learning objective.
*   **Synthetic Data Pretraining:** To overcome the lack of ground-truth explanations at scale, ExplainerPFN is exclusively pretrained on a large meta-distribution of **synthetic tabular tasks**.
    *   **Data Generation Process:** Synthetic tasks are generated by:
        1.  Sampling random Structural Causal Models (SCMs) (DAGs).
        2.  Creating synthetic datasets (`X`, `Y`) based on these SCMs.
        3.  Training a simple feed-forward neural network as a "base model" (`f_b`) on the synthetic data to get predictions (`Y_hat`).
        4.  Computing exact or near-exact Shapley values (`Φ`) for `f_b` on these synthetic tasks, which serve as ground truth.
*   **Zero-Shot Inference:** Once trained, ExplainerPFN predicts feature attributions for unseen real-world tabular datasets without requiring access to the target model (`f_b`), its gradients, or any precomputed reference explanations. It takes `(X, Y_hat)` pairs as input.
*   **Tabular Transformer Encoder:** Utilizes a transformer encoder similar to TabPFN, encoding `(x_i, y_hat_i)` pairs and capturing intra- and inter-instance dependencies.
*   **Training Objective:** Minimizes the Negative Log Predictive Density (NLPD) over discretized, standardized attribution values.
*   **Attribution Consistency:** Applies post-processing steps (mean-zero attributions, variance decomposition, instance-level efficiency) to enforce properties derived from Shapley axioms, improving fidelity and consistency.
*   **Explanation Multiplicity:** Diversifies the methods used for computing ground-truth Shapley values during meta-training (e.g., different sampling strategies, random seeds) to enhance robustness against varying explanation patterns.

### Impact

*   **Novelty:** ExplainerPFN is the **first zero-shot method** for estimating Shapley values, operating entirely without access to the underlying ML model or example explanations.
*   **Competitive Performance:** Achieves performance competitive with few-shot surrogate explainers (e.g., TabPFN, MLP, RF regressors) that *do* rely on 2–10 reference SHAP examples from the target model. This demonstrates its practical viability in resource-constrained settings.
*   **Demonstrated Feasibility:** Shows that meaningful feature attribution patterns can be recovered directly from the data distribution itself, even without knowing the underlying model.
*   **New Research Direction:** Opens a new avenue in zero-shot explainability using tabular foundation models.
*   **Real-World Application:** Crucial for auditing black-box ML systems, identifying potential biases, and improving transparency in high-stakes applications where model access is restricted.
*   **Open-Source Contribution:** Provides an open-source implementation, including the full training pipeline and synthetic data generator, fostering further research and development in this area.
